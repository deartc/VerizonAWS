# VerizonAWS

Verizon is an Internet, phone, and TV provider that has one of the best retention rates of customers (churn) in the world. This public  source Australian data set  has recorded information about 7,000 customers at the time of their contract renewal. This project analyzes data from the  marketing analytics team to examine what might lead to a customer deciding not to renew their service. 
 
 This Verizon project has several objectives:  The first objective is focusing first on customers that use Verizon for their Internet service and what  makes these customers more likely to not renew their service.  The second objective is identify the patterns that is found in their renewal service. The next objective is to make a recommendation on a marketing campaign around the patterns  found.
