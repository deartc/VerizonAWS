# VerizonAWS

Background and Objectives:

  Verizon is an Internet, phone, and TV provider that has one of the best retention rates of customers (churn) in the world. This public  source Australian data set  has recorded information about customers at the time of their contract renewal. This project analyzes data from the  marketing analytics team to examine what might lead to a customer deciding not to renew their service.  
  This Verizon project has several objectives:  The first objective is focusing first on customers that use Verizon for their Internet service and what  makes these customers more likely to not renew their service.  The second objective is identify the patterns that is found in their renewal service. The next objective is to make a recommendation on a marketing campaign around the patterns  found.
 
 To run the project do the following: Clone github.com/deartc/VerizonAWS. To run the Colab portion which lists the  data of my project, go to copyofVerizonProjectAWS.ipynb and use the Colab link to open up in Colab. Once open use runtime tab then the option "run all" to update data. Answer yes when prompted by this warning: "This notebook was not authored by Google." If you wish to alter or use file follow the instructions listed. "Please make a copy of this notebook before using it. Go to Files > Save a Copy in Drive" I used the following imported libraries: pandas, matplotlib,sns, re datetime, datasets, and data_table in the project.

Tableau can be accessed by clicking on the Tableau link. The three charts can then be accessed by clicking on the tabs at the top.

Status of project and future steps:

Defining the question:   This is determining the churn rate of Verizon internet customers.

Collecting the data:      The Verizon data was found and dataset included in Github repository.

Cleaning the data:        The data was cleaned (more cleaning may be necesssary).

Analyzing the data:       The data was initially analyzed (more analysis may be necessary).

Sharing your results:      Initial results were displayed in Tableau and Matplot. 


Future steps:             1. Refine data. Possibly do more cleaning and analysis using R or SQL 
                          2. Use machine learning. Possibly  include AWS Sage Maker to determine train/predict models.
                          3. Determine marketing plan.  I am studying human centered marketing.
